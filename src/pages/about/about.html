    <ion-item-group padding-horizontal>
      <p>UndocuHacks 2017 will be the first of its kind immigrant youth-led hackathon in the country! UndocuHacks will serve as a collaborative meeting platform and bring together professionals in the tech industry and people directly affected by immigration policies to develop technology tools of protection, education, healing, and empowerment.</p>
      <p>While everyone is welcome to apply, we highly encourage people who are currently affected by the countryâ€™s immigration policies and the lack of health insurance to apply. If you are an immigrant and have been using social media platforms and technology tools to organize your community and advocate for immigrant rights, we would love for you to join us on this amazing journey!</p>
