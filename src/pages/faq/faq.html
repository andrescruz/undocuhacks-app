    <h4>What is a hackathon?</h4>
    <p>
      A hackathon is a place where people turn ideas, food, and coffee into magic (a.k.a. code). People with different experiences and technical backgrounds work together in teams to code a solution to a specific problem. These solutions generally take the form of mobile apps, robots, and websites. More broadly defined, a hackathon is a multi-day event where people come together, ideate, and work intensively on ideas and products to change the world!
